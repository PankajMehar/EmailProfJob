As power density and device physics limit our ability to scale homogeneous multi-core processors, heterogeneity and efficiency must increase if we are to continue to get more processing capability on anything from embedded platforms to clouds for big data processing.  For applications and software to adapt to these changing platforms, we will need to develop software that can target heterogeneity and run-time systems that can adapt to dynamic workloads while handling the complexity of highly parallel, heterogeneous systems. Dr. Crago‚Äôs research group is focused on the exploration and development of software and techniques to exploit highly parallel, heterogeneous systems efficiently, in terms of performance, power, and productivity.\n",
